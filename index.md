Hi there! Welcome to my website! ðŸ˜Š

This is meant to be my "public" personal space, a bit like websites before social media were.  

This website is built using [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), which leverages [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) to manage the content.
