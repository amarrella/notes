# Avoiding "ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980" when installing a Python package in a Nix environment

By default, nix sets the epoch to be 1 (which corresponds to 1970-01-01), this causes some issues when building some Python packages. 
Since the zip might contain files from the nix store, those are dated 1970 breaking the installation of the python package.

To quickly fix the issue add this to your nix-shell
```sh
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800
```
